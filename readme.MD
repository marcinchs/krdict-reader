#### About

This is English-Korean dictionary for e-readers (e.g. _Kindle_) mainly based on [_National Institute of Korean Language's Korean-English Learners' Dictionary_](https://dict.korean.go.kr). It contains also entries from [_Extended Open Multilingual Wordnet_](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/summx.html)

- As of May 2018 it contains 18,044 (English) entries. That maps to a much bigger list of Korean words (56,182). See changelog or release notes (in mobi file) for details
- Inflections are also supported
- Most entries contain pronunciation. If they don't then probably it wasn't included in Korean Language's Korean-English Learners' Dictionary. There is no pronunciation for entries from Extended Open Multilingual Wordnet.

When I started learning Korean I looked for a dictionary I could use on my kindle but I couldn't find _any_ to use or buy, so I created this one. To my knowledge as of May 2018 it's the only English-Korean kindle dictionary available on the Internet.

#### What it is

When built as a mobi file it allows you to replace default Kindle dictionary and look up Korean words when reading an English book.

#### What it is not

While it is bilingual, it is not two way dictionary, so it won't help you if you're reading a Korean book.

#### Compatibility

It was tested on _Kindle Paperwhite_ only. It may or may not work on other devices.

#### Download

Ready to use mobi files should be available for download on [releases tab](https://github.com/marcinchs/krdict-reader/releases).

#### Building it yourself

It will take a lot of time because of the fact that you'd need to simply look up every word in an online dictionary, so probably you don't want to do it. If you do however see [howto](howto_diy.MD)

#### Alternatives

There are "quick" Korean dictionaries in StarDict format on StarDict developer <a href="http://download.huzheng.org">Hu Zheng's website</a>.
There are also free tools available on the Internet to convert them to TAB sepearated text files, and then to mobi format or even directly to mobi. I was unable to find the source of translations and unfortunately definitions are sorely lacking, nevertheless they're 2 directional dictionaries with impressive number of entries: English-Korean one has over 94,000; Korean-English almost 50,000.
