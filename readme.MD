#### About

This is English-Korean dictionary for e-readers (e.g. _Kindle_) based on [_National Institute of Korean Language's Korean-English Learners' Dictionary_](https://dict.korean.go.kr)

- As of May 2018 it contains 15,457 (English) entries. That maps to a much bigger list of Korean words (almost 52,000)
- Inflections are also supported
- Most entries contain pronunciation. If they don't then probably it wasn't included in Korean Language's Korean-English Learners' Dictionary

When I started learning Korean I looked for a dictionary I could use on my kindle but I couldn't find _any_ to use or buy, so I created this one. To my knowledge as of May 2018 it's the only English-Korean kindle dictionary available on the internet.

#### What it is

When built as a mobi file it allows you to replace default Kindle dictionary and look up Korean words when reading an English book.

#### What it is not

While it is bilingual, it is not two way dictionary, so it won't help you if you're reading a Korean book.

#### Compatibility

It was tested on _Kindle Paperwhite_ only. It may or may not work on other devices.

#### Download

Ready to use mobi files should be available for download on [releases tab](https://github.com/marcinchs/krdict-reader/releases).

#### Building it yourself

It will take a lot of time because of the fact that you'd need to simply look up every word in an online dictionary, so probably you don't want to do it. If you do however see [howto](https://github.com/marcinchs/krdict-reader/blob/master/howto_diy.MD)
