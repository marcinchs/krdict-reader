<p>Additional notes</p>

<p>I used *_base_* and *.exc files from Wordnet. These were combined with 2+2+3lem.txt file from 12dicst to create one
    file. Then all these words were looked up in National Institute of Korean Language's Korean-English Learners'
    Dictionary.

<p>
    Inflections: 2+2+3lem.txt (from 12dicst) was combined with a base nouns list from Wordnet (which I updated with
    possessives singulars) and with Wordnet's *.exc lists.
