<p>The following sources have been used to create this dictionary:</p>

<p>For English words:</p>
<ul>
    <li>list of English words and inflections from <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts">http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts</a>.
        Their git repository is here <a href="https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist">https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist</a>
    </li>
    <li>additional English words from WordNet <a
            href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">https://wordnet.princeton.edu/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For Korean translations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Korean translations and examples were taken from <a
            href="https://krdict.korean.go.kr/eng/mainAction?nation=eng">National Institute of
        Korean Language's Korean-English Learners' Dictionary</a>
    </li>
</ul>

    Without their content creating this dictionary would not be possible.

<p>
    The 12dicts lists were compiled by Alan Beale. Without his inflection list creating this dictionary would be much,
    much harder. They're released as public domain. See <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/">http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/</a>
