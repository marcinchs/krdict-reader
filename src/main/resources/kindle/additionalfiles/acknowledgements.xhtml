    Extended Open Multilingual Wordnet provides access to wordnets in a variety of languages, all linked to the
    Princeton Wordnet of English (PWN). It consists of the Open Multilingual Wordnet merged with data collected
    automatically from Wiktionary and the â€ŽUnicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR). The complete data collected
    from Wiktionary is released under a CC by SA 3.0 Licence, and the complete data collected from CLDR is released
    under the Unicode, Inc. Licence Agreement. More information and license is availabe here: <a

    <br/>
    Original project that created these wordnets is <a href="http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/index.html">Open
    Multilingual Wordnet</a>. Its page reads: "This page provides access to open wordnets in a variety of languages,
    all linked to the Princeton Wordnet of English (PWN). The goal is to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple
    languages. The individual wordnets have been made by many different projects and vary greatly in size and accuracy.
    We have (i) extracted and normalized the data, (ii) linked it to Princeton WordNet 3.0 and (iii) put it in one
    place. The Open Multilingual Wordnet and its components are open: they can be freely used, modified, and shared by
    anyone for any purpose. There is a fuller list of wordnets at the Global Wordnet Association's Wordnets in the World
    page."

    The 12dicts lists were compiled by Alan Beale. Without his inflection list creating this dictionary would be much,
    much harder. They're released as public domain. See <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/">http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/</a>
